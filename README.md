This is the practical of learning elasticsearch database and using it with springboot application


Elasticsearch is an open-source, distributed search and analytics engine designed for managing and searching large volumes of data in real-time. It falls under the category of NoSQL databases and is built on top of the Apache Lucene search library. Elasticsearch is particularly well-suited for use cases that require fast and complex searches across a variety of data types, such as text, numeric, geospatial, and more.

Key features of Elasticsearch include:

1. **Full-Text Search:** Elasticsearch excels at full-text search, enabling users to perform sophisticated queries on textual content with features like fuzzy matching, phrase matching, and stemming.

2. **Distributed Architecture:** It is designed to be distributed and scalable. Data is stored in shards, which can be spread across multiple nodes in a cluster, providing high availability and fault tolerance.

3. **Real-time Data:** Elasticsearch provides real-time search capabilities, meaning that indexed data is immediately available for searching as soon as it's ingested.

4. **Schema-less:** Elasticsearch is schema-less, which means you can index data without a predefined schema. It can automatically infer data types from the documents.

5. **RESTful API:** Elasticsearch offers a RESTful API that allows developers to interact with the system using standard HTTP methods, making it accessible from various programming languages and platforms.

6. **Aggregations:** Aggregations allow you to perform analytics on your data, generating summaries, statistics, and insights from your dataset.

7. **Geospatial Capabilities:** Elasticsearch has built-in support for geospatial data, enabling location-based searches and queries.

8. **Plugins and Extensions:** Elasticsearch can be extended with various plugins that add functionalities like security, monitoring, visualization, and more.

9. **Ecosystem:** Elasticsearch is a core component of the Elastic Stack, which includes Logstash (for data ingestion and transformation) and Kibana (for data visualization and analytics).

10. **Use Cases:** Elasticsearch is commonly used for applications like e-commerce search engines, log and event data analysis, monitoring, recommendation systems, and more.

While Elasticsearch offers powerful search and analytical capabilities, setting it up and managing it efficiently can require some expertise. It's important to carefully design your Elasticsearch clusters and indices to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.
